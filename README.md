# Facial-Recognition Weekend-proj-1
Facial Recognition with face_recognition library (python)

In this project, I used a python package named, facial recognition, to train a CNN model based on a set of data. After the training is done, a set of new unknown data is given to the model and it could recognize the new faces based on the known dataset.

The following photos are some examples of the results.

The model was intellegent enough to recognize the different ages of the same person even though the training dataset only included the same person at one age.
